Since almost everything is data for companies or industries, naturally, this data must be stored in some way to be processed. At this stage, linear and non-linear data structures are used to store the data. In today's world, all companies are slowly moving to non-linear data structures. We can explain the reasons for choosing non-linear under 3 substances. These are the demands of today's technology, speed and running costs.

Non-linear data structures are created to maximize optimization compared to other data structures. Although non-linear data structures are a bit more difficult to add raw data to data structures than others, however, the time spent to find the data you are looking for in the data pool after writing the data is so short that it cannot be compared with linear and other data structures. For example, social media platforms that have many users, make the data matching while users log in to their accounts with using non-linear data structures.

When data request created on data structs. A computer in the background obtains the data that needs to be accessed by performing the necessary operations on the data struct. The shorter period becomes, the lower the required processing load, so the speeds of non-linear data structures reduce the energy consumption of computer processors. This reduces the running costs of data centers.

The products of many software companies on big data and artificial intelligence. The main principle of non-linear data structures is to provide optimizations in these areas because of its speed.

If we sum all of them, it is obvious that non-linear data structures are the data structure that makes the fastest optimization of data writing and reading, which is the main task of data structures. Although non-linear data structures mathematically and practically difficult, but the performance of they provide is worth their complexity.
