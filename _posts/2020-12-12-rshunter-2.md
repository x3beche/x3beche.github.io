Version 2 was a little different and, to tell you the truth, it had more bugs than version 1. The reason I made version 2 was that version 1 had a very small volume (almost the size of a palm), and this prevented me from developing the product. I increased the volume in version 2, but what happened this time? We missed the end of the rope, the box was half empty. Anyway, let me explain the improvements I made. There is a square box on the far left and you can calculate the size of version 1 from there. The box control box that says 4.67 took care of all the electrical components in it, there was no cable confusion as in version 1. I replaced the old screen with a screen with a high resolution (brightness and contrast adjustment on the screen was a pretty good screen). The best feature I added to this version is that you could go to any location and run it after 1 week, it did not run out of charge. There was a very simple system with a relay and esp8266 inside, you could turn a lot of things on and off from here, for example: RP3, screen, fan, deauther. it could open and close from the outside. And some temperature values ​​could be seen from here … Sample Case: Wifi pentest using several methods with 2 wifi cards connected to Rp3 in a normal street when there is a device in my bag (a very simple example). In this version I tried adding SDR but it was a bit of a problem, I can say the trouble was energy (here we go again). This problem was not resolved in version 2 … I said at the beginning that version two was a little different, actually this version was something like a transitional form. I have come a long way here and brought myself some really good experiences. Now, in version three, it's time to combine experiences and create a real product. See you in version 3 then.
