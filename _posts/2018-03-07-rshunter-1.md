Someone I love and respect bought me the electronic set during the 2016 summer vacation. I was already interested in electronics, this set excited me even more and I started researching. I know it is an amateur project, but I was young at the time so it was not bad. At least I struggled for something better than standing still. it was an experience for me. I used a 3.5 inch screen. It was one of the worst screens I've ever seen in my life. The screen is too small. My eye is not normally broken, but I am 100% sure that this screen hurts my eye. Don't do this to yourself. There are two LEDs on the left, one of them indicates that raspberry pi is on or off. The other led shows that the arduino system below is on or off. A lot of time has passed over it, I don't know if the bottom or the top is, but the functions are in my mind. By the way, I used raspberry pi 3 in the system. As for the power problem, I used a card on the top left that both charges and boosts the lithium battery to 5v. While buying it, I looked at the size of it completely, it was quite small compared to the other products I used in the project, but over time I realized its disadvantages. When Raspberry pi was under full stress, power was not enough and it was resetting itself. I realized this over time, my beginner times … For energy, I used a tablet battery of around 3000mah and 2 units of 18650 Lithium Battery. It was enough for 2–3 hours. I added an `INCA IUWA-150M` model wifi card that I bought long ago. However, the antenna that came with this card was the best db antenna I have ever used. He was finding ssids about 3km ahead… Although there is a wifi card on raspberry pi, it is not enough, its power is very low, so I added ESP8266 to the system, I was using it for deauth attacks. The functionality of the wifi card on the raspberry pi for attacks is 0%. Everyone was interested in wifi once, and I was interested in wifi back then. There were a lot of methods. Most of it was a waste of time. I guess all the wifis I have broken in my life will not exceed the number of fingers of a hand … Chaos.Look at this chaos … Something could short circuit anytime. At that time, I was in good luck, although I did not pay attention, I did not make any short circuit. Even now, full attention is happening while working. And yes, year 2020 i still use that raspberry pi. 4 years have passed and it has been in good health. I did the last make-up and this is the result.Keyboard as final equipment. The brand of the keyboard was rii. I paid well, the price was the same as the screen. I tried many os on it. In the past, there were not many operating systems on raspberry pi, the most optimized one was Kali-Linux. I used it for a while. There are many operating systems available now, my current favorite is Dietpi. That's all for now, this was the story of `RSHunter V1`
